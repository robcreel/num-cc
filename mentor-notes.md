### Mentee notes:
> I'm coming from an R background, so I want to improve my Pythonic thinking, using classes, and object orientation.

### Quick thoughts:
Rob - it looks like this assignment demonstrates a good understanding of the pandas library. I don't think there's
much to add here in the way of classes or object orientation. One of the important principles for us programmers to
understand is YAGNI - "you ain't gonna need it." In other words, it's important not to add classes/objects/etc. when
not absolutely necessary. The general rule of thumb I like to follow is when code is reusable - i.e., it's repeated -
I can create a function (and maybe class) to house it.

If you have other code you'd like me to look at before tomorrow, I'd be more than happy to do so. See you at Dev Together!
